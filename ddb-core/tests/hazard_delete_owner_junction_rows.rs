//! Hazard H2: service-path delete of a reference OWNER leaves its auto-junction rows.
//!
//! `DoogatService::delete_doogat` (ddb-core/src/service/delete.rs:107) calls
//! `Index::cascade_junction_cleanup` (ddb-core/src/indexer/mod.rs:480-500), which
//! sweeps only the REVERSE direction: junction rows where the deleted id is the
//! referenced target (`<other>_<col>.<col>_id = id`). The SQL `DELETE` path
//! (ddb-core/src/sql_engine/dml.rs:1266-1332) additionally runs the OWNER
//! direction (`<type>_<col>.<type>_id = id`, dml.rs:1321-1327). Deleting the
//! owner of a REFERENCES value through the service (CLI `ddb delete`, GraphQL,
//! REST, FFI) may therefore strand its row in `bookmark_category` keyed by
//! `bookmark_id`. `tests/e2e/cascade_delete.rs` pins only the SQL-DELETE owner
//! case (:90-181) and the service target-side case (:263-343); the service
//! owner case is unpinned.
//!
//! A failure here means the hazard is real: the service delete path leaves
//! owner-side junction rows behind. A pass makes this file a regression pin.
