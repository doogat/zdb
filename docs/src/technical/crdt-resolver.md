# CRDT Conflict Resolution

**Source**: `zdb-core/src/crdt_resolver.rs` (487 lines)

When Git detects a merge conflict, this module resolves it using Automerge CRDT with per-zone strategies.

## Entry Point

```rust
pub fn resolve_conflicts(
    conflicts: Vec<ConflictFile>,
    crdt_strategy: Option<&str>,
) -> Result<Vec<ResolvedFile>>
```

If `crdt_strategy` is set to a non-default value (e.g. `preset:append-log`), a warning is logged since only the default strategy is implemented. The default strategy is always used.

For each `ConflictFile`:
1. Parse ancestor, ours, and theirs into three zones
2. Merge each zone with its specific strategy
3. Reassemble via `parser::serialize()`
4. Validate the result parses correctly (round-trip check)

If `resolve_conflicts` fails, `SyncManager` falls back to ours-wins (keeping local content) and logs a warning.

## Frontmatter Merge

`merge_frontmatter(ancestor, ours, theirs) -> Result<String>`

**Strategy**: Field-level CRDT map merge using Automerge.

### Algorithm

1. Convert each YAML string to `BTreeMap<String, FmValue>` where `FmValue` is either `Scalar(String)` or `List(Vec<String>)`
   - YAML sequences (e.g. tags) are preserved as `FmValue::List` for element-level merge
2. Create an Automerge document with the ancestor map — scalars as Automerge values, lists as Automerge Lists
3. Fork for "ours": apply the diff (additions, changes, deletions) from ancestor → ours
   - List diffs use set semantics: added items are appended, removed items are deleted
4. Fork for "theirs": apply the diff from ancestor → theirs
5. Merge the two forks — Automerge resolves same-key conflicts deterministically; list items from both sides are preserved
6. Extract the merged map (deduplicating list items) and convert back to YAML

**Scalar conflict**: If both sides change the same scalar field to different values, Automerge picks one deterministically (based on actor IDs).

**List merge**: Concurrent additions to the same list (e.g. tags) are both preserved. Removals are honored. This prevents data loss on concurrent tag edits.

## Body Merge

`merge_body(ancestor, ours, theirs) -> Result<String>`

**Strategy**: Character-level CRDT text merge using Automerge.

### Algorithm

1. Create an Automerge document with a text object containing the ancestor body
2. Fork for "ours": compute character-level diff (ancestor → ours) via `similar::TextDiff::from_chars()`, apply as `splice_text()` operations
3. Fork for "theirs": same process
4. Merge the two forks — Automerge resolves overlapping character edits

### Op Consolidation

Character-level diffs produce many small operations (one per character). The implementation consolidates consecutive same-type operations:

- Adjacent deletes at consecutive positions → single delete with combined count
- Adjacent inserts at the same position → single insert with concatenated text
- Operations are applied in reverse order to preserve position validity

This handles intra-line edits (e.g., one side inserts "brave " into "hello world", the other appends "!") as well as multi-line edits.

## Reference Merge

`merge_reference(ancestor, ours, theirs) -> Result<String>`

**Strategy**: Automerge List CRDT (fork-diff-merge).

### Algorithm

1. Parse ancestor, ours, and theirs into reference line vectors via `ref_lines()`
2. Create Automerge document with `ObjType::List` at root key `"refs"`, populated with ancestor lines
3. Fork for ours — apply list diff: delete removed entries (backwards for index stability), append new entries
4. Fork for theirs — same
5. Merge forks — Automerge's list CRDT preserves concurrent additions from both sides
6. Extract merged list, sort alphabetically, deduplicate, join as output

### Conflict semantics

| Ours | Theirs | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Removed | Removed | Removed |
| Removed | Present | Removed (delete wins) |
| Present | Removed | Removed (delete wins) |
| Same line | Same line | Keep one (dedup) |
| Changed value | Unchanged | Both entries survive |
| Unchanged | Changed value | Both entries survive |
| Both changed differently | Both entries present |
| Concurrent new entries | Both present (list union) |

Unlike the Map approach for frontmatter, List CRDT preserves both sides of a same-key conflict (e.g. both `- source:: A` and `- source:: B` survive). Output is sorted alphabetically and deduplicated.

## Preset: Last-Writer-Wins

`resolve_lww(conflicts) -> Result<Vec<ResolvedFile>>`

Whole-file resolution based on HLC comparison:

1. Compare `ours_hlc` vs `theirs_hlc`
2. Higher HLC wins (wall_ms → counter → node string)
3. If no HLC available, falls back to ours

Used as strategy `preset:last-writer-wins` in typedef `crdt_strategy`, and as the final fallback in the three-step merge cascade.

## Preset: Append-Log

`resolve_append_log(conflicts) -> Result<Vec<ResolvedFile>>`

Section-aware body merge for log-style zettels (e.g. project type):

1. **Frontmatter**: same as default (Automerge Map)
2. **Reference**: same as default (set merge)
3. **Body**: split by `## ` headings into sections
   - **Log sections** (entries matching `- [x] YYYY-MM-DD`): parse entries, dedup by (date, first line), union from both sides, sort chronologically
   - **Non-log sections**: default Automerge Text merge

## Compaction Strategy

CRDT temp files in `.crdt/temp/` use two naming conventions:
- Body: `{commit_oid}_{zettel_id}.crdt`
- Frontmatter: `{commit_oid}_{zettel_id}_fm.crdt`

Legacy files using bare OIDs are also supported. `parse_crdt_temp_name()` returns `(oid, zettel_id, is_frontmatter)`.

Compaction modes:

- **Cleanup**: removes temp files whose commit is an ancestor of the shared head (all nodes have synced past it). Handles both `.crdt` and `_fm.crdt` files.
- **Doc compaction**: groups remaining temp files by `(zettel_id, is_frontmatter)`, loads all Automerge changes, calls `AutoCommit::save()` to produce separate compacted blobs for body and frontmatter per zettel
- **Per-zettel**: `compact_zettel(repo, zettel_id)` targets a single zettel's CRDT history
- **Threshold check**: compaction skips when `.crdt/temp/` size is below `CompactionConfig.threshold_mb` (default 1MB) unless `--force` is passed

CLI flags: `zdb compact --force` (ignore threshold), `zdb compact --dry-run` (report what would happen).

## Round-Trip Validation

After merging all zones, the result is serialized via `parser::serialize()` and the module verifies the output parses correctly as a `ParsedZettel`. If parsing fails, a validation error is returned — this prevents corrupted merges from being committed.

## Test Coverage

25 tests:
- Frontmatter: different fields, same field conflict, field addition, field removal, YAML special chars
- Frontmatter tags: one-sided add, concurrent additions merge, tag removal honored
- Body: non-overlapping edits, append from both sides, intra-line character-level merge
- Reference: union additions, removals, same-key conflicts, concurrent additions both present
- Full pipeline: three-zone conflict resolution with re-parse validation
- Full pipeline: no ancestor (new file on both sides)
- LWW: later HLC wins, deterministic tiebreak, no-HLC fallback
- Append-log: concurrent entries survive, dedup, non-log sections use text CRDT, empty log
- Strategy: non-default crdt_strategy still resolves (with warning)
- Error: unparseable content correctly returns error (LWW fallback path)
