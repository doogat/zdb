# Git Operations

**Source**: `zdb-core/src/git_ops.rs` (454 lines)

Wraps libgit2 (`git2` crate) for all Git repository interactions. `GitRepo` is the central handle.

## GitRepo

```rust
pub struct GitRepo {
    pub repo: Repository,  // git2::Repository
    pub path: PathBuf,
}
```

## Initialization

`GitRepo::init(path) -> Result<Self>`

Creates a new Git repository with the standard directory structure:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `zettelkasten/` | Zettel Markdown files |
| `reference/` | Binary/asset files |
| `.nodes/` | Node registry (TOML configs) |
| `.crdt/temp/` | Temporary CRDT files |

Each directory gets a `.gitkeep` file. A `.gitignore` is created/updated to exclude `.zdb/` (the local SQLite index directory). A `.zetteldb-version` file is written with the current format version (currently `1`). An initial commit is made with all scaffolding.

## Format Versioning

The `.zetteldb-version` file at the repository root tracks the on-disk format version (currently `1`).

- **On init**: written with `CURRENT_FORMAT_VERSION`
- **On open**: read and checked:
  - Repo version > driver version → `VersionMismatch` error (upgrade zdb)
  - Repo version < driver version → auto-migrate (e.g. v0→v1 writes the version file)
  - Missing file → treated as v0, auto-upgraded

Future format changes increment `CURRENT_FORMAT_VERSION` and add a migration step in `migrate_format()`.

## File Operations

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `commit_file(rel_path, content, msg)` | Write, stage, and commit a single file |
| `commit_files(files, msg)` | Write, stage, and commit multiple files atomically |
| `commit_merge(files, msg, theirs_oid)` | Write files and create a merge commit with two parents |
| `read_file(rel_path)` | Read file content from HEAD tree (not working directory) |
| `list_zettels()` | Walk HEAD tree, return all `zettelkasten/*.md` paths |
| `head_oid()` | Get current HEAD commit OID |

Note: `read_file` reads from the Git tree, not the filesystem. This ensures consistency with the committed state and avoids platform-specific working-tree transforms such as CRLF checkout conversion on Windows.

All commit methods (`commit_files`, `commit_merge`, `delete_file`) and successful merge paths (`merge_remote`) write the commit-graph file via `git commit-graph write --reachable`. This accelerates `merge_base()` and log traversal. Best-effort: silently ignored if `git` CLI unavailable.

## Remote Operations

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `add_remote(name, url)` | Register a named remote |
| `fetch(remote, branch)` | Fetch from remote |
| `push(remote, branch)` | Push to remote |

Remote URLs can be local filesystem paths, SSH URLs, or any Git-compatible transport.

## Merge

`merge_remote(remote, branch) -> Result<MergeResult>`

### Algorithm

1. Find the remote branch ref (`refs/remotes/{remote}/{branch}`)
2. Run `merge_analysis()` to determine the merge type:
   - **Up-to-date**: nothing to do
   - **Fast-forward**: update ref and checkout
   - **Normal merge**: perform 3-way merge
3. For normal merges, call `merge_commits(ours, theirs)` to get a merge index
4. If the index has conflicts:
   - Extract each conflict's ancestor/ours/theirs blob content
   - Return `MergeResult::Conflicts(vec, theirs_oid)`
   - Clean up merge state
5. If clean: write the merge tree, create a merge commit with two parents, checkout

### Conflict Extraction

`extract_conflicts(index) -> Result<Vec<ConflictFile>>`

For each conflict entry in the merge index, reads the blob content for ancestor (if present), ours, and theirs. Returns `ConflictFile` structs ready for CRDT resolution.

## Signature

Uses the repository's configured `user.name` and `user.email`. Falls back to `"zdb"` / `"zdb@local"` if not configured.

## Test Coverage

8+ tests:
- Init creates directory structure and `.gitignore`
- Open existing repo
- Commit and read file round-trip
- Multi-file commits
- List zettels (filters to `zettelkasten/*.md`)
- Push/fetch cycle between two repos
- Merge already-up-to-date
- Merge conflict detection with blob extraction
