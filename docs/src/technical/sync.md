# Sync & Compaction

## Sync Manager

**Source**: `zdb-core/src/sync_manager.rs` (198 lines)

Orchestrates multi-device synchronization.

### SyncManager

```rust
pub struct SyncManager<'a> {
    pub repo: &'a GitRepo,
    pub node: NodeConfig,
}
```

### Node Registration

`register_node(repo, name) -> Result<NodeConfig>`

1. Generate UUIDv4
2. Create `NodeConfig` with name, uuid, empty `known_heads`
3. Write `.nodes/{uuid}.toml` (Git-tracked)
4. Write UUID to `.git/zdb-node` (local-only, not tracked)
5. Commit the `.nodes/` file

The local `.git/zdb-node` file identifies which node this device is. It must exist for `SyncManager::open()` to work.

### Opening

`SyncManager::open(repo) -> Result<Self>`

Reads the UUID from `.git/zdb-node`, then loads the corresponding `.nodes/{uuid}.toml` from the Git tree.

### Full Sync Cycle

`sync(remote, branch, index) -> Result<SyncReport>`

1. **Fetch**: `git fetch {remote} {branch}`
2. **Merge**: `merge_remote(remote, branch)` → get `MergeResult`
3. **Handle result**:
   - `AlreadyUpToDate` → report "up-to-date", skip push
   - `FastForward` → report 1 commit transferred
   - `Clean` → report 1 commit transferred (Git auto-committed)
   - `Conflicts` → three-step merge cascade (see below)
4. **Update state**: set `known_heads = [current HEAD]`, `last_sync = now`, commit `.nodes/{uuid}.toml`
5. **Push**: single `git push {remote} {branch}` carries both merge result and node state
6. **Commit-graph**: write once (deferred from per-commit writes during sync)
7. **Reindex**: `index.rebuild_if_stale(repo)` — incremental reindex via `diff_paths` processes only changed files

### Three-Step Merge Cascade

When conflicts occur (or a clean merge produces invalid output):

1. **Step 1: Git merge** — already performed by `merge_remote()`. If clean, validate affected files with `parser::parse()`. Invalid → extract pre-merge versions, fall through.
2. **Step 2: CRDT resolve** — call `resolve_conflicts()` with the typedef's `crdt_strategy` (or repo `default_strategy`). Validate result. Invalid or error → fall through.
3. **Step 3: LWW by HLC** — whole-file last-writer-wins using HLC comparison. Always produces a valid file.

This replaces the previous "ours-wins" fallback with a proper HLC-based resolution.

### State Update

`update_sync_state() -> Result<()>`

Sets the node's `known_heads` to the current HEAD OID and `last_sync` to the current UTC timestamp (RFC3339). Commits the updated `.nodes/{uuid}.toml`.

This propagates to other nodes on their next fetch, allowing compaction to compute the shared head.

### Listing Nodes

`list_nodes() -> Result<Vec<NodeConfig>>`

Walks `.nodes/*.toml` files in the HEAD tree, deserializes each into `NodeConfig`.

## Hybrid Logical Clocks

**Source**: `zdb-core/src/hlc.rs`

HLC combines wall clock time, a logical counter, and node ID for causally-ordered timestamps across devices.

```rust
pub struct Hlc {
    pub wall_ms: u64,   // wall clock milliseconds since UNIX epoch
    pub counter: u32,   // logical counter for same-millisecond events
    pub node: String,   // first 8 chars of node UUID (deterministic tie-break)
}
```

### Operations

- **`Hlc::now(node_id, &last)`** — tick for local event: `max(wall_clock, last.wall_ms)`, increment counter if equal
- **`Hlc::recv(node_id, &local_last, &remote)`** — merge on receive: `max(wall, local, remote)`, bump counter on ties
- **`Hlc::parse(s)` / `Display`** — sortable format: `{wall_ms}-{counter:04}-{node}`
- **`Ord`** — compare wall_ms → counter → node (deterministic total order)

### Integration

- **Commit trailers**: merge commits include `\n\nHLC: {hlc}` trailer, parsed via `extract_hlc()`
- **SyncManager**: `tick_hlc()` on local merge, `recv_hlc()` on remote merge, persisted in `NodeConfig.hlc`
- **ConflictFile**: HLC fields populated from commit trailers for LWW resolution. `extract_conflicts()` calls `find_hlc_for_path()` to walk commit ancestry and extract HLC from the most recent commit touching each conflicting path. `validate_clean_merge_or_fallback()` does the same for post-merge validation conflicts.

## Compaction

**Source**: `zdb-core/src/compaction.rs`

Cleans up temporary CRDT files, merges per-zettel CRDT docs, and runs Git garbage collection. Reports before/after storage measurements.

### Shared Head Calculation

`shared_head(repo, nodes) -> Result<Option<Oid>>`

Finds the greatest common ancestor (GCA) commit across all **active** nodes' `known_heads`. Stale and retired nodes are excluded — this allows compaction to proceed even when some devices are offline.

1. Collect the first `known_head` from each active node
2. If only one node, return its head directly
3. Iteratively compute `merge_base()` across all heads

The shared head represents the latest commit that all active devices have synced. Anything before it is safe to compact.

### CRDT Temp Cleanup

`cleanup_crdt_temp(repo, shared_head) -> Result<usize>`

Removes files in `.crdt/temp/` whose commit OID is an ancestor of the shared head (i.e., all devices have already applied those changes). Preserves `.gitkeep` and files newer than the shared head.

### CRDT Doc Compaction

`compact_crdt_docs(repo) -> Result<usize>`

Groups remaining CRDT temp files by `(zettel_id, is_frontmatter)` and merges multiple Automerge documents per group into a single compacted doc. Body and frontmatter are compacted independently.

### Git GC

`run_gc(repo_path) -> Result<bool>`

Runs `git gc` (not `--aggressive`) for pack consolidation and object deduplication.

### Full Pipeline

`compact(repo, sync_mgr, force) -> Result<CompactionReport>`

1. **Threshold check**: skip if `.crdt/temp/` < `threshold_mb` (unless `force`)
2. Measure `.crdt/temp/` size and file count (before)
3. Measure `.git/` directory size (before)
4. Compute shared head from active nodes
5. Clean up CRDT temp files older than shared head
6. Compact CRDT docs per zettel
7. Measure `.crdt/temp/` size and file count (after)
8. Run `git gc`
9. Measure `.git/` directory size (after)

### CompactionReport

```rust
pub struct CompactionReport {
    pub files_removed: usize,        // temp files deleted in step 5
    pub crdt_docs_compacted: usize,  // zettels merged in step 6
    pub gc_success: bool,            // git gc exit status
    pub crdt_temp_bytes_before: u64, // .crdt/temp/ bytes before cleanup
    pub crdt_temp_bytes_after: u64,  // .crdt/temp/ bytes after compaction
    pub crdt_temp_files_before: usize,
    pub crdt_temp_files_after: usize,
    pub repo_bytes_before: u64,      // .git/ bytes before gc
    pub repo_bytes_after: u64,       // .git/ bytes after gc
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Cascade

When a sync detects conflicting changes, resolution follows a three-step cascade (see `cascade_resolve` in `sync_manager.rs`):

```
Step 1: Git three-way merge (libgit2)
  ↓ if conflicts remain
Step 2: CRDT per-zone merge (Automerge)
  ↓ if result fails validation (parser::parse)
Step 3: LWW by HLC (whole-file, later timestamp wins)
  ↓ if LWW also fails (shouldn't happen)
Step 4: Ours-wins (last resort)
```

### Step 2: CRDT merge (default strategy)

Each conflicting file is split into three zones and resolved independently:

| Zone | Strategy | What wins on conflict |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Frontmatter scalars | Automerge Map CRDT | Deterministic by actor/op ordering |
| Frontmatter lists | Three-way set merge | Union of additions, removals honored |
| Body | Automerge Text CRDT | Non-overlapping edits merge; overlapping resolved by CRDT |
| References | Automerge List CRDT | Union, deduplicated, sorted alphabetically |

### Step 3: LWW fallback

Triggered when Step 2 produces invalid output or errors (e.g., corrupted CRDT state). Compares HLC timestamps on the conflicting commits; the later writer's **entire file** replaces the earlier one. If no HLC is present, defaults to "ours" (local version).

### After compaction

When CRDT temp files have been compacted away, Step 2 still runs — it reconstructs the three-way merge from `ancestor`/`ours`/`theirs` content in Git. The difference is that prior CRDT operation history is lost, so the merge creates fresh Automerge docs rather than extending existing ones. In practice this produces identical results for most edits.

If the reconstructed merge produces invalid markdown (rare edge case), the cascade falls through to Step 3 (LWW).

### Preset strategies

| Strategy | When used | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `preset:default` | No typedef or typedef doesn't specify | Per-zone CRDT merge (Step 2) |
| `preset:last-writer-wins` | Typedef specifies LWW | Skip Step 2; go straight to HLC comparison |
| `preset:append-log` | Typedef specifies append-log | Frontmatter + references use CRDT; body log sections use union + chronological sort |

### User-visible outcomes

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Non-overlapping edits | Both edits preserved |
| Same field edited on both sides | CRDT picks one deterministically (not random) |
| One side deletes, other edits | Edit wins; `resurrected: true` added to frontmatter |
| Stale node returns after compaction | Step 2 runs from Git content; usually succeeds |
| CRDT error + no HLC | Falls back to local version (ours-wins) |

**E2E tests proving these paths:**
- `stale_node_resync_after_compaction` — LWW fallback after CRDT state removed
- `stale_node_edits_deleted_zettel_after_compaction` — edit-vs-delete after compaction
- `multiple_stale_nodes_return_sequentially` — cascade through multiple compaction cycles
- `bundle_recovery_after_compaction` — bootstrap from post-compaction bundle

## Test Coverage

### Sync Manager (4 tests)
- Register and open node
- List nodes
- Open without registration fails
- Sync state update

### Compaction (4 tests)
- GC runs successfully
- Cleanup empty temp directory
- Cleanup removes temp files (preserves `.gitkeep`)
- Full compact pipeline

### Integration (2 tests in `tests/sync_test.rs`)
- Two-node sync without conflicts
- Two-node sync with conflict resolution (both nodes reach identical state)

### Multi-device simulation (6 tests in `tests/e2e/multi_device.rs`)
- 3-node convergence (all edit, sync round-robin, verify identical state)
- Concurrent creates (all nodes create simultaneously, sync cascade)
- Stale node return (one node offline, others sync, stale returns)
- Network partition and reconnect (split groups, both edit, reconnect and merge)
- Bundle full bootstrap (export full from node, import on fresh node)
- Air-gapped delta transfer (export bundle, import on disconnected node)
- Stale node resync after compaction (conflict with compacted CRDT state, LWW fallback)

## Performance

### NFR-03: Two-node sync under 2s at 5K zettels

Measured on macOS (Apple Silicon), release build, localhost bare remote.

Scenario: 5000 zettels seeded, fast-forward sync of 10 new zettels.

| Phase | Before (ms) | After (ms) |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| fetch | 13 | 12 |
| merge | 65 | 44 |
| push | 18 (2 pushes) | 13 (1 push) |
| update_sync_state | 26 | 8 |
| reindex | 10101 | 24 |
| **total** | **10226** | **118** |

### Optimizations applied

1. **Incremental reindex** — replaced `index.rebuild()` (full 5K re-parse) with `rebuild_if_stale()` which uses `incremental_reindex` to diff `old_head..new_head` and process only changed files. 421x improvement for the reindex phase.
2. **Single push** — merged two pushes (content + node state) into one by reordering `update_sync_state()` before push.
3. **Deferred commit-graph** — `write_commit_graph()` skipped during mid-sync commits, written once at the end via `set_skip_commit_graph` flag on `GitRepo`.
